    "- imports data from the census\n",
    "    - for demographic data (note that rn the API call doesn't do much, but it is very simple to change) The packages `census` and `states` format our web requests which makes the process very easy for us. Small issue that I haven't been able to track down a list of codes for our info, so pop. data is non-existant. this should not be a hard fix\n",
    "    - for shape files this is the is the `tract_shapes` dataframe which is very useful. it will likely be the most granular location data we use. also, `school_shapes` dataframe, we will use it to get some info about the current system, and then it will be very useless.\n",
    "- imports current school districts and concatanates them with the tracts. this combo is not that useful, but i wanted to see how much they lined up. the answer is basically not at all. I also made the `dist_tracts` dataframe which takes all the individual areas of intersection. I think we should stick to either tracts or block groups because this wierd combo will make getting info very hard.\n",
    "- imports data from NEICES (this is likely not the actual abreviation) which gives us location and population of every single school\n",
    "- in the next 2h I will hopefull aggregate schools with tracts and this will all become much more functional. \n",
    "# Before you run:\n",
    "- make sure you have all the dependendencies i refer to (including `descartes` which is not listed but is an implicit geopandas dependency)\n",
    "- Places which say `PATH` require: get the path of this file on your own computer and put it in place of that string (this won't run until you replace all of these, there are 3)"
